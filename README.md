1. In the  class GameTileFactory.java, the method getTile() randomly gets a tile from different tiles class. By using switch case, the method randomly choose a class of Gametiles to creates a new Gametiles and return it with the parameter passing in. 
2. PA5 is complicated for it has four method that are very long and those four methods share same logic. After refactoring method, we only have one method that are very long and other three limit in 5 lines.
I have learnt that when you have to write more than one methods that share same logic and structure, you can write a implement method to use the main structure in one method and call this method and implement method to make your code terse. # YUL-2048
